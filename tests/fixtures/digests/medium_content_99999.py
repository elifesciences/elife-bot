They are tremendously important for our health, but remain difficult to understand, since a microbial community typically consists of hundreds of species that interact in complex ways that we cannot fully characterize. It is tempting to ask whether one might instead characterize such a community as a whole, treating it as a multicellular "super-organism". However, taking this view beyond a metaphor is controversial, because the formal criteria of multicellularity require pervasive levels of cooperation between organisms that do not occur in most natural communities.</p><p>In nature, entire communities of microbes routinely come into contact – for example, kissing can mix together the communities in each person’s mouth. Can such events be usefully described as interactions between community-level "wholes", even when individual bacteria do not cooperate with each other? And can these questions be asked in a rigorous mathematical framework?</p><p>Mikhail Tikhonov has now developed a theoretical model that shows that communities of purely "selfish" members may effectively act together when competing with another community for resources. This model offers a new way to formalize the "super-organism" metaphor: although individual members compete against each other within a community, when seen from the outside the community interacts with its environment and with other communities much like a single organism.</p><p>This perspective blurs the distinction between two fundamental concepts: competition and genetic recombination. Competition combines two communities to produce a third where species are grouped in a new way, just as the genetic material of parents is recombined in their offspring.</p><p>Tikhonov’s model is highly simplified, but this suggests that the "cohesion" seen when viewing an entire community is a general consequence of ecological interactions. In addition, the model considers only competitive interactions, but in real life, species depend on each other; for example, one organism\'s waste is another\'s food. A natural next step would be to incorporate such cooperative interactions into a similar model, as cooperation is likely to make community cohesion even stronger.</p><hr/><p><em>Originally published at <a href="https://elifesciences.org/digests/99999">https://elifesciences.org/digests/99999</a>.</em></p>'),
