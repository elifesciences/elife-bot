                "text": "The inflammatory environment of demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients contributes to remyelination failure. Inflammation activates a cytoprotective pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), but it remains unclear whether enhancing the ISR can improve remyelination in an inflammatory environment. To examine this possibility, the remyelination stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as well as a mouse model that incorporates cuprizone-induced demyelination along with CNS delivery of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 were used here. We demonstrate that either genetic or pharmacological ISR enhancement significantly increased the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons in the inflammatory lesions. Moreover, the combined treatment of the ISR modulator Sephin1 with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene increased myelin thickness of remyelinated axons to pre-lesion levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promotes remyelination in the presence of inflammation, suggesting that ISR enhancement may provide reparative benefit to MS patients.",

Failure of myelin repair during relapsing-remitting MS leads to chronically demyelinated axons, which is thought to contribute to axonal degeneration and disease progression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Franklin and Kotter, 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fancy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chari, 2007</a>).

Strategies to enhance myelin regeneration could preserve axonal integrity and increase clinical function of patients. A number of small molecules have recently been described to promote OPC maturation and/or enhance remyelination, but most of these molecules were identified in in vitro screens under ideal conditions and tested in animal models of non-inflammatory demyelination (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deshmukh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mei et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rankin et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Najm et al., 2015</a>).

The ISR is a cytoprotective pathway that is activated by various cytotoxic insults, including inflammation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</a>). The ISR is initiated by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor two alpha (p-eIF2\u03b1), by one of four known stress-sensing kinases, to diminish global protein translation and selectively allow for the synthesis of protective proteins. p-eIF2\u03b1 is dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)- DNA-damage inducible 34 (GADD34) complex to terminate the ISR upon stress relief (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang and Kaufman, 2008</a>). Sephin1, a recently-identified small molecule, disrupts PP1-GADD34 phosphatase activity and prolongs elevated p-eIF2\u03b1 levels, thereby enhancing the ISR protective response (<a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Carrara et al., 2017</a>). We previously showed that GADD34 deficiency or Sephin1 treatment protects matures oligodendrocytes, diminishes demyelination, and delays clinical symptoms in a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2019</a>).

Using these inflammatory demyelination models, we show that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and increases the level of remyelination. Moreover, we explored the effects of combining Sephin1 treatment with bazedoxifene (BZA) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rankin et al., 2019</a>) on remyelination. BZA has been shown to enhance OPC differentiation and CNS remyelination in response to focal demyelination (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rankin et al., 2019</a>).

Sephin1 (8 mg/kg) or vehicle treatment was initiated in each EAE mouse on the day it reached the peak of disease (clinical score = 3) and was continued to the late stage of EAE, which resulted in diminished EAE disease severity in the final week of Sephin1 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Spinal cord axons were examined under electron microscope (EM). We sorted remyelinated axons by examining g-ratios (axon diameter / total fiber diameter) in the lumbar spinal cord white matter of EAE mice after vehicle or Sephin1 treatment. The presence of axons with thinner myelin sheaths and a higher g<i>-</i>ratio is considered the hallmark of remyelination (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duncan et al., 2017</a>). A recent study indicated that axons in the spinal cord with a g-ratio greater than 0.8 are likely remyelinated axons in the EAE model (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mei et al., 2016</a>). Our data demonstrated that the density of remyelinated axons (g &gt; 0.8) was significantly higher in EAE mice treated with Sephin1 than those treated with vehicle (p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.81) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), although no difference was detected in the total number of myelinated axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The data suggest that Sephin1 promotes remyelination in the neuroinflammatory environment of EAE, presumably by protecting remyelinating oligodendrocytes against inflammatory stress.",

To examine this possibility, we used a more quantitative demyelination/remyelination model (cuprizone model) for further exploration. We have previously shown that in response to IFN-\u03b3, myelinating oligodendrocytes with a <i>Ppp1r15a (Gadd34)</i> mutation display increased levels of p-eIF2\u03b1, indicating a prolongation of the ISR, and increased oligodendrocyte survival (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). We hence mated GADD34 KO;GFAP-tTA mice with GADD34 KO;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 mice to generate GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double-transgenic mice homozygous for the <i>Ppp1r15a</i> mutation (GADD34 KO) to prolong the ISR (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double-transgenic mice allow for ectopic release of IFN-\u03b3 in the CNS in a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). Expression of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) is driven by the astrocyte-specific transcriptional regulatory region of the <i>Gfap</i> gene. In the TRE-IFN-\u03b3 mice, the IFN-\u03b3 cDNA is transcriptionally controlled by the tetracycline response element (TRE) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The expression of the IFN-\u03b3 transgene is repressed in the GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 mice by providing water treated with Dox from conception. At 6 weeks of age, transgenic mice were taken off Dox water to induce CNS expression of IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3+) and placed on a diet of 0.2% cuprizone chow (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2004</a>). After 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure, mice were placed back on a normal diet for up to 3 weeks to allow remyelination to occur. Control mice received Dox water throughout the study to repress CNS expression of IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3-) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Mice with the highest level of IFN-\u03b3 expression in the CNS were selected by isolating the cerebellum of each mouse and using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to determine IFN-\u03b3 expression levels. We found that at 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure (W5) and during remyelination (W8), removal of Dox significantly increased the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the cerebellum of mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).",

It has been demonstrated that cuprizone-fed mice exhibit apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes and demyelination in the corpus callosum. Complete remyelination spontaneously occurs a few weeks after the cuprizone challenge is terminated (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matsushima and Morell, 2001</a>). We found no significant difference in the number of cells labeled with the mature oligodendrocyte marker ASPA between GADD34 wildtype (WT) and GADD34 KO, GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double-transgenic mice before cuprizone exposure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). After 5 weeks on cuprizone chow, both GADD34 WT and KO double-transgenic mice presented similarly with a significantly reduced number of ASPA+ mature oligodendrocytes in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3+) (WT, p&lt;<i>0.001</i>; KO, p&lt;<i>0.05</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). During the remyelination period, ASPA+ oligodendrocytes reappeared and reached approximately 800/mm<sup>2</sup> in both IFN-\u03b3-repressed GADD34 WT and KO mice (IFN-\u03b3-) after 3 weeks of normal chow. In the presence of IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3+), this number dropped in the lesions of WT double-transgenic mice to roughly 500/mm<sup>2</sup> of ASPA+ cells (p&lt;<i>0.05</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>), which is consistent with our previous finding that IFN-\u03b3 expression in the CNS suppresses the repopulation of oligodendrocytes following cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte toxicity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>). Compared to GADD34 WT, GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 mice with the <i>Gadd34</i> mutation had significantly increased numbers of ASPA+ oligodendrocytes during remyelination in the presence of IFN<i>-\u03b3</i> (IFN-\u03b3+/W8) (p&lt;<i>0.01</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). Myelin status in these mice was also evaluated with EM. After 5 weeks of cuprizone chow, a significant number of axons exhibited myelin sheath loss in control mice (IFN-\u03b3<i>-</i>), compared to 0 weeks (WT, p&lt;<i>0.0001</i>; KO, p&lt;<i>0.001</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). Similarly, both WT and KO double-transgenic mice presented with markedly reduced numbers of myelinated axons in the presence of IFN<i>-</i>\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3+) (WT: 25.2 \u00b1 3.0%, p&lt;<i>0.0001</i>; KO: 24.4 \u00b1 2.7%, p&lt;<i>0.0001</i>). Nevertheless, no difference in the percentage of myelinated axons was observed between IFN-\u03b3+ and IFN-\u03b3- groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). At 3 weeks after cuprizone withdrawal, both IFN-\u03b3-repressed WT and KO mice (IFN-\u03b3-) showed spontaneous remyelination (WT: 42.7 \u00b1 6.2%; KO: 42.6 \u00b1 4.7%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Meanwhile, remyelination was significantly suppressed in the corpus callosum of IFN<i>-</i>\u03b3-expressing WT mice (WT: 29.4 \u00b1 2.9%) (p&lt;<i>0.05</i>), but not in that of IFN<i>-</i>\u03b3-expressing KO mice (KO: 49.1 \u00b1 8.8%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Together, these data suggest that prolonging the ISR has no impact in the absence of IFN-\u03b3, but it results in increased repopulation of oligodendrocytes and remyelination following demyelination in the presence of IFN-\u03b3.",

In addition, Sephin1 protects mature oligodendrocytes against inflammation in the EAE model (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2019</a>). Therefore, using Sephin1, we tested the ability of pharmacological enhancement of the ISR to protect remyelinating oligodendrocytes from inflammatory insults in the cuprizone model. Similar to the GADD34 mouse experiment, 6-week-old GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double transgenic mice that had been on Dox water since conception were either kept on (IFN-\u03b3-) or removed from Dox (IFN-\u03b3+) and fed with a chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks. Mice were then placed back on a normal diet for 3 weeks. Sephin1 (8 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered daily to the mice by intraperitoneal injections beginning 3 weeks after the start of the cuprizone diet. This time point represents the peak of oligodendrocyte loss during cuprizone-mediated demyelination (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matsushima and Morell, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).",

Next, we investigated the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum by immunofluorescent staining of ASPA. 3 weeks of cuprizone exposure led to a significant decrease of the ASPA+ oligodendrocytes in both IFN-\u03b3- (p&lt;<i>0.01</i>) and IFN-\u03b3+ (p&lt;<i>0.01</i>) groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). After 5 weeks of cuprizone chow, we did not detect further oligodendrocyte loss in the absence of IFN-\u03b3. It has been shown that oligodendrocytes start regenerating after significant loss at 3 weeks, even in the presence of cuprizone (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armstrong et al., 2006</a>). We observed a further reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes in the presence of IFN<i>-</i>\u03b3 (p&lt;0.01), although we found no difference between vehicle and Sephin1 treatment (veh: 315 \u00b1 44/mm<sup>2</sup>; Seph 394 \u00b1 67/mm<sup>2</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>).

In addition, we observed an approximate 50% reduction in the percentage of myelinated axons after 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure in both IFN-\u03b3- and IFN-\u03b3+ double-transgenic mice (<i>p&lt;0.0001</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). Similar to the changes in oligodendrocyte numbers, our data demonstrated that during remyelination, CNS delivery of IFN-\u03b3 resulted in diminished numbers of remyelinated axons (p&lt;<i>0.05</i>), while mice treated with Sephin1 exhibited a significantly higher percentage of remyelinated axons (veh: 30.3 \u00b1 3.3%, Seph: 43.2 \u00b1 4.6%, p&lt;<i>0.01</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.72) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). These data indicate that although the pharmacological enhancement of the ISR with Sephin1 has no impact in the absence of IFN-\u03b3, it can provide protection to remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promote remyelination in the presence of IFN-\u03b3.",

We next tested the hypothesis that the effectiveness of a remyelination-enhancing agent would be augmented in an inflammatory environment when combined with an ISR enhancing agent. BZA is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is currently FDA-approved to be used in combination with conjugated estrogen in menopausal women (<a href=\"#bib37\">McKeand et al., 2014</a>). Recently, Rankin et al. showed that BZA significantly enhances OPC differentiation and accelerates remyelination in the lysolecithin non-inflammatory demyelination model (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rankin et al., 2019</a>). To test whether the effectiveness of BZA would be enhanced in the presence of inflammation by ISR modulation, we combined BZA and Sephin1 treatments in our cuprizone GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double transgenic model. We began the daily administration of BZA and Sephin1 3 weeks after the start of the cuprizone diet and withdrawal of Dox from the animal\u2019s water (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). At 3 weeks after cuprizone withdrawal, we found that Sephin1, BZA, and combined Sephin1/BZA treatment significantly increased ASPA+ oligodendrocyte numbers in the corpus callosum during remyelination in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 (W8/ IFN-\u03b3+) (Sephin1: p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.78; BZA: p&lt;<i>0.01</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.67; Sephin1/BZA: p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>). Accordingly, compared with vehicle controls, a significant increase in the percentage of myelinated axons was noted in the groups treated with Sephin1, BZA, and combined Sephin1/BZA treatment (Sephin1: p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.81; BZA: p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.77; Sephin1/BZA: p&lt;<i>0.01</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.80) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,D</a>). Nonetheless, no difference between treatment groups was observed either for oligodendrocyte survival or number of remyelinated axons, although the number of remyelinated axons in treatment groups reached pre-lesion levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,D</a>). In addition to measuring the percentage of myelinated axons, we also examined myelin thickness using EM analysis of g-ratios after remyelination and using W0 as the pre-lesion reference point. The vehicle-treated mice (W8/IFN-\u03b3+) demonstrated significantly thinner myelin than those at W0 (IFN-\u03b3-). In contrast, corpora callosa axons in mice receiving the combination treatment of Sephin1 and BZA (g-ratio: 0.778 \u00b1 0.006) reached myelin thickness levels comparable with pre-lesion W0 axons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,E</a>). The g-ratios of myelinated axons were significantly lower in the combination treatment group than the vehicle-treated group (p&lt;<i>0.01</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) or either of the single treatment group (p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.72 vs Sephin1, p&lt;<i>0.05</i>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.72 vs BZA).",

The adverse extracellular environment of MS lesions is thought to contribute to remyelination failure (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chew et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Frischer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kuhlmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008a</a>). Efforts to re-populate oligodendrocytes that remyelinate neuronal axons within the CNS will advance reparative therapeutics for MS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Franklin and Kotter, 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fancy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chari, 2007</a>). Although many agents identified from high-throughput screening studies appear to accelerate remyelination, it is unclear whether they are capable of initiating repair and restoring neuronal function in a complex inflammatory environment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deshmukh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mei et al., 2016</a>). A recent study, which investigated the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived oligodendrocytes from MS patients, indicated that the inflammation in MS lesions is a major contributor to impaired remyelination, and many remyelinating agents failed to restore impaired differentiation caused by inflammation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Starost et al., 2020</a>). Our mouse model used here, which combines primary demyelination induced by cuprizone with CNS delivery of IFN-\u03b3, provides a unique platform to facilitate the assessment of remyelination therapies in the setting of inflammation. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that prolonging the ISR provides protection to mature oligodendrocytes, which maintain the myelin sheath, from inflammatory attack (<a href=\"#bib52\">Way and Popko, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Way et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2019</a>). Herein we investigated whether a similar enhancement of the ISR would provide protection to newly generated remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promote the repair of demyelinated axons in a neuroinflammatory environment.",

Here, we demonstrated that Sephin1 treatment, when initiated at the peak of disease, facilitated the clinical recovery of the EAE animals, which correlated with enhanced remyelination. These results motivated us to examine the remyelination enhancing potential of an augmented ISR in a more controlled model of CNS remyelination.",

                    "text": "To further investigate the potential of the ISR to confer protection to remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelination during inflammation, we utilized an inducible double-transgenic mouse model (GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3) to temporally deliver IFN-\u03b3 to the CNS in the cuprizone model (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>). The T cell cytokine IFN-\u03b3 is a critical inflammatory mediator of MS/EAE pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lees and Cross, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ottum et al., 2015</a>). In addition, it has been suggested that IFN-\u03b3 could induce immune transitions of OPCs and oligodendrocytes to an inflammatory state with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II presentation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kirby and Castelo-Branco, 2020</a>). IFN-\u03b3 delivery is required because cuprizone-induced demyelination/remyelination occurs in the absence of an adaptive immune response and thus does not reflect the inflammatory environment in the MS lesions. Importantly, the level of IFN-\u03b3 present in the CNS of GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double transgenic mice is approximately equivalent to that of EAE mice (data not shown), which suggests that Dox-controlled IFN-\u03b3 release is within the range observed in inflammatory demyelination. Our previous studies with GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 double-transgenic mice demonstrated that ectopic expression of IFN-\u03b3 in the CNS results in a reduction in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination during development, and results in diminished remyelination following cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte toxicity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>). In our current study we found that CNS expression of IFN-\u03b3 suppresses the repopulation of oligodendrocytes and results in diminished numbers of remyelinated axons following cuprizone-induced demyelination. In the GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-\u03b3 model, it takes about 2\u20133 weeks for IFN-\u03b3 levels to become elevated in the CNS following the removal of Dox from the animal\u2019s diet (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>). Since Dox removal occurred at the time of the initiation of cuprizone exposure, the majority of mature oligodendrocytes had already been lost (W3) by the time IFN-\u03b3 levels became elevated. Therefore, in this model, mainly newly generated remyelinating oligodendrocytes are exposed to IFN-\u03b3. Using the same mouse model, our group previously showed that the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the remyelination process in the cuprizone model is associated with an activated ISR response in remyelinating oligodendrocytes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, GADD34 deficiency or Sephin1 treatment, both of which prolong the ISR, significantly increased the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons in the presence of IFN-\u03b3. Nevertheless, the enhancement of the ISR had no effect on remyelination in the absence of IFN-\u03b3. This is consistent with a recent study that showed that guanabenz, a drug closely related to Sephin1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2015</a>), did not improve remyelination in the non-inflammatory cuprizone model of demyelination (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thompson and Tsirka, 2020</a>).",

                    "text": "The genetic and pharmacologic approaches used here to modulate the ISR do not target specific cell types in the CNS. The increased numbers of remyelinating oligodendrocytes that result from an enhanced ISR might originate from increased OPC survival in the lesion or from more efficient OPC differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes. We observed that proliferating OPC numbers at the peak of cuprizone-induced demyelination were diminished by the presence of IFN-\u03b3, which is consistent with previous findings that showed that IFN-\u03b3 predisposed OPCs to apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chew et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kirby et al., 2019</a>). Nevertheless, prolonging the ISR by the <i>Gadd34</i> mutation or by Sephin1 treatment did not alter the number of proliferating OPCs in the presence of inflammation. Therefore, it is likely that the benefits of ISR enhancement on remyelination in the presence of inflammation are primarily due to the protection of actively myelinating oligodendrocytes, similar to what we have observed during developmental myelination (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chew et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2005</a>).",

We show here that BZA can promote remyelination in the presence of the inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3, which provides valuable preclinical support to the current MS clinical trial of BZA as a remyelination-enhancing agent (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> Identifier: NCT04002934). Encouragingly, we found that the combination treatment of BZA and Sephin1 resulted in more axons with thicker myelin, indicating a more substantial recovery. Although with our current data we cannot exclude the possibility that this combination treatment might protect mature oligodendrocytes and myelin during cuprizone-induced demyelination, we believe that because the treatment was started at the time-point of substantial oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination in the corpus callosum, it is more likely that the primary beneficial effect is on the repopulation of oligodendrocytes and remyelination. The myelin sheaths of remyelinated axons are uniformly thin regardless of axon diameter, but the underlying mechanism that controls the thickness of remyelinated axons is unknown (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fancy et al., 2011</a>). Although previous studies have shown that the transgenic overexpression of neuregulin (<i>Nrg</i>) or the conditional knockout of <i>Petn</i> increases myelin sheath thickness in developmental myelination, the remyelinated myelin sheaths remain thin in these models (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brinkmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Harrington et al., 2010</a>). Increased myelin thickness after the combination treatment of BZA and Sephin1 in our inflammatory de/remyelination model suggests that remyelination can be more efficiently induced by using therapies promoting OPC differentiation in combination with therapies that protect the remyelinating oligodendrocytes against inflammatory environment.",

Our current study demonstrates that the ISR modulator Sephin1 protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the presence of an inflammatory environment, leading to remarkably improved remyelination. In our previous EAE study, we showed that Sephin1 protects mature oligodendrocytes, myelin and axons, in addition to indirectly dampening the CNS inflammation that drives EAE (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2019</a>). We also showed that combining Sephin1 with the anti-inflammatory MS drug IFN-\u03b2 resulted in an additive effect in alleviating EAE.

The same mice were then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) in PBS for 15 min. The brains were removed and cut coronally at approximately 1.3 mm before the bregma. The posterior parts of the brains were post-fixed overnight and embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA). The tissue was sectioned in a series of 10 \u00b5m on a cryostat. Cryosections were treated with acetone at \u221220\u00b0C, then blocked with PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C. Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Coronal sections at the fornix region of the corpus callosum corresponding to Sidman sections 241-251 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sidman et al., 1972</a>). Primary antibodies include the following anti-MBP (Abcam, ab24567, 1:700), anti-ASPA (Genetex, GTX113389, 1:500), anti-Ki67 (Abcam, AB15580, 1:100), anti-PDGFR-alpha (BD Biosciences, 558774, 1:100), and anti-Iba1(Wako Pure Chemical, 09\u201319741, 1:500). The fluorescent stained sections were scanned with Olympus VS-120 slide scanner and quantified by ImageJ. At least three serial sections of corpus callosum were quantified. The representative fluorescent images were acquired under Nikon A1R confocal microscope. The investigators were blinded to allocation of treatment groups in the processes of image capture and the following quantification.",

The sections corresponding to the corpus callosum were trimmed, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate. Sections were then dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in propylene oxide, and embedded in EMBed 812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). EAE mice were perfused with EM buffer, and then the lumbar spinal cords were processed, embedded, and sectioned as above. Semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue. Samples were next ultrathin sectioned on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome. Grids were examined on a FEI Tecnai Spirit G2 transmission electron microscope. We calculated the total percentage of remyelinated axons averaged from 10 images (area = 518.3504 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) in each mouse. G-ratio was calculated as the ratio of the inner diameter to the outer diameter of a myelinated axon; a minimum of 300 fibers per mouse was analyzed.

This paper demonstrates that the integrated stress response (ISR), a cytoprotective pathway, crucially contributes to the protection of oligodendrocytes and improves remyelination during inflammation. Both pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to prolong the ISR, which led to increased numbers of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons in animal models of disease.",

We have previously reported that Sephin1 can prolong the phosphorylated status of eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) in IFN-\u03b3 stressed oligodendrocytes in culture. We also observed a significant increased number of p-eIF2\u03b1 positive oligodendrocytes in the spinal cords of Sephin1 treated EAE mice, compared to EAE controls (Chen et al., 2019). In addition, using this GFAP/tTA;TRE/IFN-\u03b3 double-transgenic transgenic model, our group previously showed that the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the remyelination process in the cuprizone model is associated with an activated ISR response in oligodendrocytes (Lin et al., 2006). In the presence of IFN-\u03b3, the levels of ISR markers (CHOP and p-eIF2\u03b1) were significantly increased during remyelination; whereas the ISR does not appear activated in the cuprizone model in the absence of IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, our previous report demonstrated that the genetic disruption of the ISR inhibited remyelination in the cuprizone model in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 (Lin et al., 2006). In the current manuscript we examined whether prolonging the ISR response would enhance remyelination in an inflammatory environment. We have more clearly described this background information in the revised manuscript.",

BZA, which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to significantly enhance OPC differentiation and CNS remyelination. In our study, the enhancement of the ISR, genetically or with Sephin1, provided protection to remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the presence of inflammation. In other words, BZA promotes remyelination and ISR enhancement permits remyelination to occur in the presence of inflammation. We speculated that remyelination-enhancing agents would be even more effective when combined with Sephin1. We have included a more detailed description of the rationale behind these studies in the revised manuscript (Results). We agree that the differences in g-ratio likely reflect an increase in the rate of remyelination in the presence of BZA and Sephin1. We have now discussed this possibility in the revised manuscript. We have not, however, changed the Abstract, since the statement here is factual, not an interpretation of the results: \u201cthe combined treatment of Sephin1 with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene increased myelin thickness of remyelinated axons to pre-lesion levels\u201d.",

Oligodendrocyte protection through an enhanced ISR only occurs when the ISR is activated in our model by the presence of IFN-\u03b3. In our previous study, we showed that Sephin1 protected mature oligodendrocytes (i.e. those that are maintaining a myelin sheath) at the peak of EAE disease, where the ISR is activated by CNS inflammation (Chen et al., 2019). In the GFAP/tTA;TRE/IFN-\u03b3 transgenic model, it takes about 2 to 3 weeks for IFN-\u03b3 levels to become elevated following the removal of dox from the animal\u2019s diet (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1) (Lin et al., 2006). In this study, we remove dox at the time of the initiation of cuprizone exposure; therefore the majority of mature oligodendrocyte have already been lost by the time IFN-\u03b3 levels increase. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript (Discussion).",
