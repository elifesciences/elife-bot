ligands Gas6 and Protein S are poorly understood. We have used biochemical and genetic analyses to delineate the rules for TAM receptor–ligand engagement and find that the TAMs segregate into two groups based on ligand specificity, regulation by phosphatidylserine, and function. Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both ligands but only Gas6 activates Axl. Optimal TAM signaling requires coincident TAM ligand engagement of both its receptor and the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer): Gas6 lacking its PtdSer-binding ‘Gla domain’ is significantly weakened as a Tyro3/Mer agonist and is inert as an Axl agonist, even though it binds to Axl with wild-type affinity. In two settings of TAM-dependent homeostatic phagocytosis, Mer plays a predominant role while Axl is dispensable, and activation of Mer by Protein S is sufficient to drive phagocytosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03385.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03385.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03385.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells send out and receive signals to communicate with other cells. Detecting these signals is largely carried out by proteins called receptors that span the cell surface membrane. These proteins typically have extracellular domains outside of the cell that can bind to specific signaling molecules and an intracellular domain inside the cell that relays the information inwards to trigger a response.</p><p>Three such receptor proteins are collectively known as the TAM receptors. Each day, many billions of cells in the human body die and are engulfed by other cells and broken down so that their building blocks can be reused. TAM receptors are required for this process; and the TAM receptors also help prevent the immune system from going out of control, which would damage the body's own tissues.</p><p>Two different signaling proteins, called Gas6 and Protein S, can bind to and activate TAM receptors. Both of the signaling proteins can also bind to a phospholipid molecule that is found on the surface membrane of dead cells. However, it is not known if all three TAM receptors bind to both signaling proteins equally, and the importance of the phospholipid-binding domain in the signaling proteins remains unclear.</p><p>To shed light on the workings of these receptors, Lew et al. created mouse cells that each only express one out of the three TAM receptors. These cells were then exposed to intact Gas6 and Protein S, or shortened versions that lacked the phospholipid-binding domain. Lew et al. found that Gas6 could trigger a response through all three TAM receptors but that Protein S was specific for only two out of the three receptors. Signaling proteins with or without their phospholipid-binding domains bound equally well to the receptors, but the maximum level of response was only triggered when both signaling proteins were intact and the phospholipid molecule was present. This is important since the phospholipid can be thought of as an ‘eat-me’ signal by which the dead cells are recognized by the TAM receptor-expressing cells that will engulf them.</p><p>Using mice that only produce a TAM receptor called Mer, Lew et al. show that Protein S alone can trigger the process that engulfs and breaks down cells in a living organism. These data and previous work suggest that two TAM receptors—including Mer—are involved in the daily engulfment of dying cells, whereas the third mediates this process during infection and tissue damage.</p><p>Molecules that inhibit or activate the function of TAM receptors are currently being developed to treat cancer and other diseases. By revealing which receptors respond to which signaling molecules, the findings of Lew et al. will serve to guide these efforts.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03385.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03385.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Gas6</kwd><kwd>Pros1</kwd><kwd>Axl</kwd><kwd>Mertk</kwd><kwd>Tyro3</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI077058, R01 AI101400, R01 NS085296, P30 CA014195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lemke</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

In these settings, TAM signaling regulates multiple functions but two are especially prominent. The first is the ‘homeostatic’ or silent phagocytosis of the billions of apoptotic cells (ACs) that are generated on a daily basis throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemke and Burstyn-Cohen, 2010</xref>).

Conversely, over-expression or aberrant activation of Tyro3, Axl, or Mer (gene name <italic>Mertk</italic>) is associated with the development, progression, and metastasis of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avilla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cummings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paccez et al., 2014</xref>).

Gas6 is thought to function as a ligand for all three receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stitt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1997</xref>), but the role of Pros1 as a ligand for one or more TAM receptors has until recently been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godowski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafizi and Dahlback, 2006</xref>). At the same time, the unique structural features of Gas6 and Pros1—in which a C-terminal ‘SHBG domain’ binds to the Ig-like domains of TAM receptors while an N-terminal γ-carboxylated ‘Gla domain’ binds, in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent reaction, to the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemke and Rothlin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemke, 2013</xref>)—have led to conflicting conclusions as to the relative importance of these two domains in receptor binding vs activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mark et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanabe et al., 1997</xref>). Although Gas6 and Pros1 binding to the PtdSer-containing membranes of enveloped viruses potentiates TAM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meertens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>), and the Gla domain is thought to be required to ‘bridge’ a TAM receptor expressed on the surface of a phagocyte to the PtdSer expressed on the surface of its AC target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemke and Rothlin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemke and Burstyn-Cohen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>), a preparation of recombinant mouse Gas6 that lacks the Gla domain entirely is sold commercially as a TAM activator.</p><p>Potentially distinct roles for Pros1 and Gas6 in vivo have only recently begun to be appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrera Silva et al., 2013</xref>), and to date only a single genetic study of the importance of Gas6 vs Pros1 in a TAM-dependent process has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). This study addressed TAM signaling during the phagocytosis of photoreceptor (PR) outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strauss, 2005</xref>), which express Mer and Tyro3 but no Axl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prasad et al., 2006</xref>). RPE phagocytosis of the PtdSer-displaying tips of PR outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruggiero et al., 2012</xref>) requires Mer—mice, rats, and humans that carry loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>Mertk</italic> gene are blind, due to the cell-non-autonomous degeneration of nearly all PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Cruz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duncan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prasad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nandrot and Dufour, 2010</xref>). This cell death results from the accumulation of toxic oxidated proteins that are generated during the course of phototransduction and are removed by phagocytosis. Retinal loss of either the mouse <italic>Gas6</italic> or <italic>Pros1</italic> gene alone yields a retina with a normal number of PRs, but the combined loss of <italic>Pros1</italic> and <italic>Gas6</italic> results in a PR degeneration phenotype that fully phenocopies the cell death seen in <italic>Mertk</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). While this analysis demonstrated that Pros1 is sufficient to drive Mer-dependent phagocytosis in RPE cells, the presence of Tyro3 in these cells raised the possibility that Pros1 activation of the Mer kinase might be dependent on Pros1 binding to Tyro3.</p><p>In the current study, we have used biochemistry, receptor activation profiling, and genetic analyses of single and compound mouse mutants to establish the basic rules for TAM ligand–receptor interaction, signaling, and function. We find that Gas6 activates all three TAM receptors, but is an especially potent ligand for Axl, with which it has a unique association. In contrast, Pros1 activates Tyro3 and Mer but is inactive as an Axl agonist. Notably, we find that the Gla domains of TAM ligands are dispensable for receptor binding but are critical for optimal receptor activation, and that for Gas6 activation of Axl, this requirement is absolute. We conclude that a complete TAM signaling module is composed of a receptor, a γ-carboxylated protein ligand, and the phospholipid PtdSer, a tripartite arrangement that is unique to the TAM family. Finally, we show that Mer is the functionally predominant TAM receptor in two different settings of ‘homeostatic’ PtdSer-dependent phagocytosis in vivo–in the retina and the testes–and that Pros1 binding to and activation of Mer alone is sufficient to ensure wild-type levels of phagocytosis in these settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Derivation of assay tools</title><p>We first generated highly pure preparations of recombinant mouse Gas6 and Pros1.

[Selected examples of TAM expression in cultured cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>] This suggests that all prior analyses of TAM receptor activation have been encumbered by the expression of endogenous Tyro3 and/or Axl and/or Mer.</p><p>We generated multiple clonal cell lines in the background of the TAM TKO MEFs that express HA-tagged versions of mouse Tyro3, Axl, and Mer, respectively.

We measured activation of single receptors expressed in MEFs by monitoring their tyrosine phosphorylation 10 min after ligand addition to cells in serum-free medium, using immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the individual receptors (or their C-terminal HA tag) followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (see ‘Materials and methods’). We found that both purified human and recombinant mouse Pros1 (hPros1 and rmPros1, respectively) were capable of rapidly activating Tyro3 autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In our hands, purified hPros1 was more stable biochemically and often more potent than rmPros1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and we therefore used the human protein for the majority of the Pros1 experiments described below. However, both the mouse and human ligands were active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Consistent with these observations, both mouse and human Pros1 were also recently found to be active as ligands for a chimeric receptor comprised of the mouse Tyro3 ectodomain linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the R1 chain of the interferon (IFN)-gamma (γ) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsou et al., 2014</xref>).

We found that both ligands were capable of activating this receptor in Mer-expressing MEFs, but that rmGas6 was more potent than hPros1 in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Finally, as our Mer-expressing MEFs have much lower receptor levels than Tyro3 or Axl-expressing MEFs, we also performed the same analysis using dexamethasone-treated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (Dex_Mϕ). These cells have levels of Mer comparable to those of Tyro3 or Axl in the MEF cell lines and do not express any other TAM receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McColl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zagórska et al., 2014</xref>; and data not shown).

We found that although both full-length and Gla-less rmGas6 were capable of activating Tyro3, the full-length protein was markedly (∼20-fold) more potent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When we performed this same comparison for Axl-expressing MEFs, we observed an even stronger dependence. Full-length Gas6 was a very potent Axl ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left 6 lanes), but the Gla-less version was incapable of activating Axl at any concentration tested (up to 750 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right 6 lanes). We found that this stark disparity was unique to Axl. When we compared the ability of full-length and Gla-less rmGas6 to activate Mer in Mer-expressing Dex-Mϕ, we observed a pattern similar to that seen for Tyro3. Although both forms of the ligand were capable of activating Mer, full-length Gas6 was ∼20-fold more potent than its Gla-less counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the TAM receptors fall into two groups based on features of their ligand and PtdSer activation profiles: Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both Gas6 and Pros1, whereas Axl is activated only by Gas6; and while Gla-less Gas6 is a substantially weaker ligand for Tyro3 and Mer, it is effectively dead as a ligand for Axl.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03385.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The role of the Gla domain in TAM receptor activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) Tyro3-expressing MEFs, Axl-expressing MEFs, or dexamethasone-treated BM-derived macrophages expressing Mer, respectively, were stimulated with the indicated increasing concentrations of full-length rmGas6 or Gla-less rmGas6, respectively.

Thus, the inability of Gla-less Gas6 to activate Axl is unrelated to its ability to bind the receptor; and conversely, the ability of a Gas6 variant to bind Axl is unrelated to its ability to activate the receptor. These properties suggest that a crystal structure of the Axl ectodomain bound to Gla-less Gas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>) represents a ligand-occupied but inactive Axl configuration. In related work, we have found that these properties are also exceptionally important to Gas6–Axl binding and signaling in tissues in vivo, where Gas6 appears to be specifically and constitutively bound to Axl without significant activation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zagórska et al., 2014</xref>).

Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the PtdSer-binding protein Annexin A5 antagonized Gas6 activation of Tyro3 in Tyro3_TAM TKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore probed for the presence of PtdSer in MEF cultures directly. We co-incubated MEFs (grown under the same conditions we used for activation studies) with propidium iodide (PI) and the fluorescent Annexin B12 derivative pSIVA, a polarity-sensitive biosensor that fluoresces only when bound to PtdSer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruggiero et al., 2012</xref>), and then analyzed the cells by flow cytometry.

Together, these results demonstrate that there are PtdSer-displaying membranes present in the MEF cultures. It is important to note that the molecular weight of PtdSer is ∼385 g/mol, while Gas6 and Pros1 have molecular weights of ∼80,000 g/mol, and that the crystal structure of the prothrombin Gla domain bound to lyso-PtdSer contains only a single molecule of this phospholipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2003</xref>).

First, Gas6 alone is capable of binding to and activating Tyro3, Axl, and Mer when these receptors are expressed in isolation and is especially potent as a ligand for Axl. Second, Pros1 alone is capable of binding to and activating Tyro3 and Mer but does not function as a ligand for Axl. Third, the PtdSer-binding Gla domain of Gas6, PtdSer itself, and calcium are all required for optimal receptor activation but none is required for receptor binding. Fourth, ligand binding does not translate into receptor activation: Gla-less Gas6 binds as well to Axl as does its full-length counterpart, but is dead as an activator, and full-length Gas6 binds to Axl in the presence of EDTA but does not activate. Fifth, receptor heterodimerization is not an essential feature of TAM activation, since the TAM receptors can be activated by purified single ligands when expressed as single receptors in MEFs in the absence of any other TAM receptor, and in the retina, Mer activation in wild-type and Tyro3-deficient RPE cells is equivalent. Sixth, in the two settings of PtdSer-dependent ‘homeostatic’ phagocytosis—by RPE cells in the adult retina and Sertoli cells in the adult testes—Mer is the functionally predominant TAM receptor. And seventh, in these settings, Pros1 binding to and activation of Mer alone is sufficient to ensure wild-type levels of phagocytosis.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03385.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Rules of engagement for TAM receptor ligand interaction and signaling.</title><p>Gas6 activates all three TAM receptors independently, but Axl is uniquely dependent on Gas6: Pros1 activates Tyro3 and Mer but not Axl.

Gla-less Gas6 is dead as a ligand when assayed against Axl in isolation. Its Axl-bound orientation is schematized differently from Tyro3- and Mer-bound Gla-less Gas6, since the latter two result in partial kinase activation, although there are no structural data for these complexes.

While Gas6 was widely regarded as a universal TAM ligand, the role of Pros1 in TAM-mediated signaling has, until recently, been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godowski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stitt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012</xref>), and older data regarding the relative potency of Gas6 and Pros1 in the binding and activation of the specific TAM receptors in vitro were conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1997</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, all prior analyses of receptor activation following the addition of TAM ligands to cultured cells were confounded by the presence of endogenous TAM receptors in the cell lines used for these analyses. Together with earlier work from our group in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012</xref>), the studies of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref> represent the only use of molecular genetics to parse differential TAM receptor–ligand signaling interactions in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A lipid-regulated, calcium-regulated kinase in which the lipid and calcium are both extracellular</title><p>Our experiments suggest a model in which the interaction between distinct TAM receptors and ligands defines a signaling signature that is specific for each ligand–receptor pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This is best illustrated in the case of Gas6 activation of Axl, which is uniquely dependent on Gas6 for activation. Both full-length Gas6 and a Gla-less Gas6 variant that lacks its PtdSer-binding Gla domain bind to Axl with the same sub-nanomolar equilibrium dissociation constant, yet the former is an extremely potent Axl agonist while the latter is inactive, whether assayed in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, full-length Gas6 cannot activate Axl in the presence of EDTA, which disrupts the binding of the Gas6 Gla domain to PtdSer. In a related study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zagórska et al., 2014</xref>), we have found that just as Axl is uniquely dependent on Gas6 for activation, so is Gas6 uniquely dependent on Axl for its stable localization in several different tissues in vivo. We find that Axl is constitutively pre-bound to Gas6 in these tissues but that this binding does not result in significant Axl activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zagórska et al., 2014</xref>). Together, all of these observations suggest that the induced exposure of PtdSer is actually the regulated trigger for TAM activation and that the TAM receptor–ligand pair is in reality a PtdSer detector. They also suggest that a crystal structure of the two Ig-like domains of the Axl ectodomain bound to two molecules of Gla-less Gas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>) reflects the structure of an inactive complex.</p><p>We propose that an effective TAM signaling complex in vivo is always tripartite, in that it is always composed of a TAM receptor, a Gla domain-containing TAM ligand, and the phospholipid PtdSer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This configuration is unique to the TAMs. In this regard, it is important to note that all settings of TAM-dependent ‘homeostatic phagocytosis’ are strictly co-dependent upon the exposure of PtdSer on the surface of the phagocytic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shiratsuchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruggiero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemke, 2013</xref>). In the case of RPE cell phagocytosis of juxtaposed PR outer segment tips, PtdSer is locally exposed only on these outer segment tips (i.e., not on the remainder of the photoreceptor) and only during the narrow window after subjective dawn in which phagocytosis occurs each day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruggiero et al., 2012</xref>). The activity of Gla domains is also Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, as these ions both stabilize the folded structure of the domain and also interact with PtdSer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhyay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases represent a novel addition to the set of enzymes, such as protein kinase C, whose activities are regulated by both calcium and lipid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard and Hurley, 2011</xref>). The key difference for the TAMs is that neither the lipid nor the calcium binds the kinase directly. Instead, they bind the TAM ligands, which are outside the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Axl–Gas6 and inflammation</title><p>The dependence of Axl on Gas6 may be relevant to the fact that all of the very low level of Gas6 that is present in blood appears to be complexed with soluble Axl (sAxl) extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekman et al., 2010c</xref>).

This will be particularly important in the context of cancer, since tumors profiled in the TCGA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/</ext-link>) that exhibit mutation or expression changes in the <italic>Tyro3</italic>, <italic>Axl</italic>, and <italic>Mertk</italic> genes display a strong tendency towards mutually exclusive TAM changes across tumor types.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>A common complaint is the use of human S protein in much of the work instead of the murine S protein. This seems to be a big problem in the reviewers' minds and will need to be addressed. Either much of the work will have to be repeated with the mouse protein, or some disclaimers will have to be injected into the paper that convince us that this is not an important issue.</p><p>There are several complaints about quantification of the responses, titration of stimuli, error bars, and saturation of responses. The points seem clearly laid out. I think the complaints have merit and need to be addressed, either experimentally or verbally. Good quantification, with error bars, is needed to validate the claims drawn from the data. This would seem to be a major part of the paper and so must be dealt with.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 major comments</italic>:</p><p>The paper describes a large body of work to address important questions related to the TAM receptors and their ligands. The authors have created unique reagents and the results obtained are very interesting and valid. The paper addresses questions that have previously been studied by others, but the unique set of reagents make it possible for them to give clear answers. The work is of high quality and the conclusions are valid. I have the following concerns the authors need to address:</p><p>The authors have used human protein S in the majority of the experiments as it showed to be more potent than murine protein S as a TAM-activator. In a study wanting to compare the physiological role of TAMs and their ligands in a defined setting, this is not really relevant. The study would benefit from using murine protein S throughout the study.</p><p>In the experiments testing the thrombin-cleavage-dependent effects of protein S, I am not convinced the protein S has been fully processed. Have the authors verified that the thrombin cleavage is complete (e.g. using a GLA-antibody on a western blot)? As the authors state that only half the physiological amounts of protein S is needed in vivo to activate TAMs, a partial thrombin cleavage might not show strong effects in a stimulation experiment. Likewise, it would be good to use in addition a lower protein S concentration for the stimulation to see a dose dependence, as well as to study also Mer phosphorylation in the same setup. In addition, it is not clear to me why the authors have used mouse proteinS for this experiment whereas most other are performed with human protein S.</p><p>The authors discuss the role of ptdser in TAM activation by Gas6 and suggest that ptdser is always needed for optimal TAM activation. An experiment on receptor phosphorylation in the presence of an excess of liposomes with and without ptdser could easily show if there is an added effect of circulating ptdser. In addition, it is not clear whether the authors suggest that ptdser-exposure on the same cell as TAM-expression or ptdser in circulation/on interacting cells is the crucial factor.</p><p>The authors claim that sAxl is released from the cell surface upon Axl activation. This has not been clearly shown and should not be addressed as a fact. An experiment studying sAxl release into the cell culture supernatant upon Gas6-mediated Axl stimulation could give more support to this claim.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2 major comments</italic>:</p><p>Lew et al. describe an interesting set of studies of ligand engagement and activation in the TAM family, clearing up several important issues and providing some valuable observations. Using purified ligands and MEFs engineered to express single TAMs (a clear and elegant system for these studies), they show that Gas6 functions as a ligand for Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. They argue that Axl is most potently activated (see point1 and 2 below). On the other hand, the authors show that Pros1 activates Tyro3 and Mer, but argue that it does not activate Axl ( see point 1 and 3 below). They further show that the Gla domain is important for activation – but not necessarily for receptor binding, and Axl appears most dependent on the presence of the Gla domain in Gas6 (see point 4 below). The observed differences appear to track with the Ig domains of the receptors. Finally, the data supporting Pros1/Mer signaling in retinal phagocytosis are quite compelling, and isolate that signaling axis impressively in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, and seem to support separate signaling functions of each receptor/ligand pair.</p><p>The systems used to tease out the signaling relationships here are excellent, and the data very informative for a poorly understood and interesting system. As a result, the manuscript should be of wide interest. There are a few important problems, though, most notably the tendency to draw quantitative conclusions about relative potencies from dose-response curves that are not saturated, and from data presented without proper quantitation or assessment of error (see point 1). The conclusions seem like they are broadly correct, but these biochemical data need to be presented in a way that can be objectively evaluated. Points 1-3 focus on this issue, which really needs to be addressed properly before publication should be considered.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) There is a general concern throughout the manuscript that interpretations about relative potencies (and half-max ligand concentrations) are made without quantitation or (therefore) error bars – and it is not stated how many repeats of each analysis were done. This issue resurfaces in several of the comments below that concern quantitative interpretations. Using Licor to follow tyrosine phosphorylation, results of quantification of 3 or more repeats needs to be shown, with error, for comparison of potencies etc.</p><p>2) The dose-response assessment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> does not really show that rmGas6 is a 'more effective' ligand for Axl than Tyro3. Neither assessment reaches saturation of receptor phosphorylation (see point 1 above), and the trends with ligand concentration look very similar as far as they go. If the two receptors saturate at different pY/4G10 signals, the half maximal values may very well be the same (with no higher activation for Axl). There are similar problems with many of the dose-response curves in the paper (although signal may be saturated in rmGas6 activation of Tyro3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figure 3A and 5</xref>), making comparisons difficult.</p><p>3) Given the background signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (compared with 2E), it is difficult to be completely convinced that hPros1 activates Mer but not Axl. There is clearly some Mer activation - although it remains unclear what hPros1 concentration is required to saturate. For Axl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, comparison of the 5, 10, and 50nM lanes suggest some activation - but the 100nM lane argues otherwise (how many times was this done - the authors do not say). It is difficult to know whether this is a problem with just that sample. Comparing Pros1 activation of Mer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and</xref> (claimed lack of) Axl activation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> also reduces confidence. The data need to be quantitated in order to make the quantitative comparison made here (as done for Mer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> but not for Axl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Error bars also need to be provided for the Licor-based quantitation – with statement of how many repeats were performed – if the case for Pros1 activation of Mer but not Axl is to be made convincingly.</p><p>4) One has to wonder how physiologically significant is the difference between Axl and the other TAMs in terms of Gla domain dependence. Whereas Gla-less Gas6 seems to lose efficacy for Axl, removal of the Gla domain still reduces potency perhaps 20-50 fold for Mer and Tyro3. It would be helpful for the authors to put this into physiological context. What is the functional difference between 'dead' and 20-50 fold impaired for Gas6? Is there any?</p><p>5) Was cell surface expression of ECDTIgITKA confirmed, to exclude the trivial possibility that it is not accessible to hPros1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3 major comments</italic>:</p><p>Lew et.al. investigated the mechanisms of signaling mediated by Gas6 and protein S via interaction(s) with TAM receptors (TYRO3, Axl, Mer). Cell lines derived from TAM knockout mice enabled them to analyze the ability of Gas6 and protein S to elicit signaling from each type of TAM receptor by ectopically expressing one type of the receptors. They found that Gas6 can elicit signaling through all TAM receptors, while protein S can only do so through Mer and TYRO3. Using chimeric receptors, they demonstrated that the extracellular Ig domains of the receptors determine the ability of the receptors to elicit signaling in response to protein S. They also found that interactions between the Gla domain of protein S/Gas6 and phosphatidylserine are necessary for optimal signaling. They analyzed the roles of protein S, Gas6, and TAM receptors in phagocytosis in the retina and testis, using various types of knockout mice. Based upon analysis of knockout mouse phenotypes and their data from <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the signaling mechanisms, they claim that Mer and protein S play a predominant role in phagocytosis in the retina and testis. This reviewer sees two major concerns regarding experimental design used in this study:</p><p>1) The authors used human protein S in studies investigating the mechanisms of signaling in murine TAM receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5 fig6">Figures 2C F, 5D, and 6B</xref>). Because the activity and specificity of protein S and Gas6 could be species-specific (ref. Hafizi and Darlback, FEBS J., 2006), it is not clear whether all the data acquired with human protein S are applicable to the signaling mechanisms of murine protein S. In addition, preparation of human protein S differed from that of murine protein S and Gas6; human protein S was purified from human serum, and both murine and human protein S were generated as His-tag-conjugated recombinant proteins. Therefore, comparison of human protein S and murine Gas6 abilities to induce signaling can be influenced by many factors, including purification methods, presence of tag sequence, and efficiency and types of post-translational modifications.</p><p>Because the data that compare signaling activity and specificity of murine protein S and Gas6 are very important to properly interpret the mouse <italic>in vivo</italic> data, most of the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments investigating signaling mechanisms of protein S should be performed using murine protein S.</p><p>2) The authors claim that PtdSer exposed on a small fraction of cultured cells binds to the Gla domain of protein S and Gas6, and this binding is necessary for optimal signaling via TAM receptors. To clearly show that PtdSer exposed on minor cell populations plays a critical role in Gas6/protein S signaling, it will be necessary to demonstrate that induction of PtdSer exposure and elimination of exposed PtdSer on cells affect the magnitude of signaling by protein S/Gas6.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03385.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A common complaint is the use of human S protein in much of the work instead of the murine S protein.

We have included significant additional data using recombinant mouse Protein S as a ligand for the TAMs, and have also cited recently published (e-published ahead of print) work in which human and mouse Protein S were found to be equivalent with respect to their ability to activate a hybrid receptor composed of either the Tyro3 or Mer extracellular domain linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the R1 chain of the IFNγ receptor. (Activation of the hybrid chimeras was monitored by STAT1 phosphorylation.) In general, we have used the purified human protein only because it is (for unknown reasons) more stable biochemically over time than the recombinant mouse protein that we produce and purify.

For unknown reasons, the purified human protein is in our hands slightly more potent and significantly more stable biochemically than the recombinant mouse protein.</p><p>This is the main reason that we have used it for many of our experiments. However, both the human and mouse proteins show the same specificity and are active ligands for mouse Tyro3 and Mer. We have now indicated this in the Results section of the revised paper. As suggested by Reviewer 1, we have also included additional results obtained with our recombinant mouse Protein S, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panels B, E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>. We have also cited a recent paper from Tsou <italic>et al.</italic> (<italic>J. Biol. Chem</italic>., in press, pii: jbc.M114.569020) in which mouse Protein S and human Protein S were compared with respect to their ability to induce STAT1 phosphorylation upon activation of a hybrid receptor composed of either the Tyro3 or Mer extracellular domain linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the R1 chain of the interferon-γ receptor. Human and mouse Protein S were found to be equivalently good ligands for both mouse Mer/γR1 and mouse Tyro3/γR1, as monitored by the activation of STAT1.</p><p><italic>In the experiments testing the thrombin-cleavage-dependent effects of protein S, I am not convinced the protein S has been fully processed. Have the authors verified that the thrombin cleavage is complete (e.g. using a GLA-antibody on a western blot)? As the authors state that only half the physiological amounts of protein S is needed in vivo to activate TAMs, a partial thrombin cleavage might not show strong effects in a stimulation experiment. Likewise, it would be good to use in addition a lower protein S concentration for the stimulation to see a dose dependence, as well as to study also Mer phosphorylation in the same setup. In addition, it is not clear to me why the authors have used mouse proteinS for this experiment whereas most other are performed with human protein S</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer 1 is correct on each of these points. The problem that we face is that if we allow the thrombin incubation to run long enough for all of the Protein S to be cleaved, all of its bioactivity is lost. This is in spite of the fact that in intact serum, in which almost of the Protein S is thrombin-cleaved, the resident Protein S is a strong Tyro3 ligand. (It is important to remember that the objective of the experiment was test if cleavage is required to <italic>activate</italic> Protein S, which is apparently not the case since rmPros1 is active <italic>before</italic> thrombin cleavage.) Since these results are equivocal and not relevant to the main points of the paper, we have removed this supplemental panel from the revised paper.</p><p><italic>The authors discuss the role of ptdser in TAM activation by Gas6 and suggest that ptdser is always needed for optimal TAM activation. An experiment on receptor phosphorylation in the presence of an excess of liposomes with and without ptdser could easily show if there is an added effect of circulating ptdser</italic>.</p><p>We published a similar experiment last year (Bhattacharyya <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic> 14(2): 136-47, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in which we titered increasing concentrations of Gas6 and Protein S, in the absence or presence HIV-1-derived retroviruses that display PtdSer on the surface of their membrane envelopes. (The high level of surface PtdSer on HIV-1 allows the virus to be purified using Annexin V affinity methods; e.g., Callahan <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>J. Immunol</italic>. 170: 4840.) We showed that the presence of the PtdSer-containing membranes dramatically shifted the dose-response curves (to lower protein concentration) for both Mer activation by Protein S and Axl activation by Gas6. In addition, the paper referenced as ‘Zagórska <italic>et al.</italic> submitted’ is now in press at <italic>Nature Immunology</italic>.</p><p>This paper contains a similar experiment using PtdSer-expressing apoptotic cells, and reaches the same conclusion. We have cited these experiments, and highlighted their significance in the Results section of the revised paper.</p><p><italic>In addition, it is not clear whether the authors suggest that ptdser-exposure on the same cell as TAM-expression or ptdser in circulation/on interacting cells is the crucial factor</italic>.</p><p>In the case of the two settings that we analyze genetically in the paper – the phagocytosis of the distal ends of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells in the eye, and the phagocytosis of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells in the testis – the PtdSer is unambiguously expressed on the membrane surface of an apposed cell. Without question, this is also the case for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. In all of these settings, the phagocyte has the TAM receptor, which is TAM-ligand-bridged to the engulfment target, which displays the PtdSer. We do not exclude the possibility the PtdSer-rich membranes might bind ligand and thereby activate a TAM receptor in the same cell, but we envision that the geometry of this signaling interaction will make these situations unusual.</p><p><italic>The authors claim that sAxl is released from the cell surface upon Axl activation. This has not been clearly shown and should not be addressed as a fact. An experiment studying sAxl release into the cell culture supernatant upon Gas6-mediated Axl stimulation could give more support to this claim</italic>.</p><p>Related experiments have been published. The Wilhelm <italic>et al.</italic> paper that we cite (<italic>J. Neurochem.</italic>, 2008, 107: 116) demonstrates that Axl cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases occurs subsequent to Axl activation (tyrosine phosphorylation), and can be inhibited by the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001. We also cite (in the Discussion section of the revised paper) results from our in-press <italic>Nature Immunology</italic> paper, in which we show that antibody-induced Axl activation in tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> is accompanied by Axl proteolytic cleavage, and that the extent of cleavage is correlated with the level of Axl activation (more tyrosine phosphorylation, more cleavage).</p><p>Reviewer 2 major comments:</p><p><italic>[The] manuscript should be of wide interest.

Using Licor to follow tyrosine phosphorylation, results of quantification of 3 or more repeats needs to be shown, with error, for comparison of potencies etc</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed these concerns with respect to activation profiles as detailed in our responses to the specific points of Reviewer 2 that follow. Although most of the immunoblots in the paper are indeed Licor blots, the panels showing Mer activation have a signal that is too low to be detected using Licor and these had to be developed using ECL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panels G, H, and supplement 1, as indicated in the figure legends). This is due to the lower Mer expression that we discuss in the Results section. Therefore, we could not use universal quantification for all the receptors. Instead we have shown multiple representative examples of our results. For example, in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the reader can now see three separate dose-response results for rmGas6 activation of Tyro3, all of which reach saturation. In the revised paper, we have also moderated the discussion of half-max ligand concentrations.</p><p><italic>2) The dose-response assessment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref> <italic>does not really show that rmGas6 is a 'more effective' ligand for Axl than Tyro3.

We chose MEF lines that express approximately equal levels of Tyro3 and Axl (based on expression of the HA tag) and we can often detect Axl phosphorylation at slightly lower Gas6 levels than we can detect Tyro3 activation. However, Gas6 is indeed a strong ligand for both Axl and Tyro3. (Compare, for example, new panels 2B first 8 lanes, 2D left 7 versus right 7 lanes, and 2E left 7 lanes. All of these new panels reach saturation.) We have revised the text accordingly, in the Results section. Perhaps the most salient point of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> analysis is that Axl can <italic>only</italic> be activated by Gas6.</p><p><italic>3) Given the background signal in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> <italic>(compared with 2E), it is difficult to be completely convinced that hPros1 activates Mer but not Axl.

We have also added new panels F and H to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which show that hPros1 is able to activate Tyro3 and Mer but not Axl. The ‘some activation’ of Axl by Pros1 mentioned by Reviewer 2 reflects lower molecular weight bands that are seen specifically in α-pY blots for Axl-expressing MEFs only when Axl is <italic>not</italic> activated by exogenous Gas6 – they consistently disappear when Axl is activated, and they do not increase in intensity with increasing concentrations of either rmPros1 or hPros1. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> panel D, lane 8; panel E, lanes 1 and 8-11; and panel F, lanes 8-14.) We have clarified the nature of these bands (which may reflect a low basal level of phosphorylation due to MEF production of endogenous Gas6) in the legend to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. These new data are consistent with our original data, and clearly demonstrate that neither hPros1 nor rmPros1 can activate Axl. They are also consistent with the in-press work of Tsou <italic>et al.</italic> (<italic>J. Biol. Chem</italic>., in press, pii: jbc.M114.569020) cited above, in which mouse Pros1 was found to be able to activate STAT1 phosphorylation downstream of hybrid receptors composed of the ectodomain of either Tyro3 or Mer linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the R1 chain of the IFN-γ receptor, but <italic>not</italic> to activate a similar hybrid receptor containing the Axl ectodomain. This is now discussed in the Results section.</p><p>Finally, in our in-press <italic>Nature Immunology</italic> paper, we show that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages that exclusively express Mer can be stimulated by both Gas6 and Protein S, whereas phagocytosis in macrophages that express exclusively Axl can only be stimulated by Gas6. In concert, all of this new work overwhelmingly argues that Axl is activated by Gas6 but not by Protein S.</p><p><italic>4) One has to wonder how physiologically significant is the difference between Axl and the other TAMs in terms of Gla domain dependence</italic>. <italic>Whereas Gla-less Gas6 seems to lose efficacy for Axl, removal of the Gla domain still reduces potency perhaps 20-50 fold for Mer and Tyro3. It would be helpful for the authors to put this into physiological context. What is the functional difference between 'dead' and 20-50 fold impaired for Gas6? Is there any?</italic></p><p>This is an interesting possibility, but one that we can’t address definitively.</p><p>It is indeed possible that a 20-50-fold reduction in potency might mean that the Gla-less Gas6 is effectively inert as a Tyro3 or Mer ligand <italic>in vivo</italic>, but this will depend on local ligand concentration, clustering, and other variables. However, the key point we want to make is that in this assay system, there is clearly a difference between Tyro3/Mer and Axl – this time in terms of the ability of Glaless Gas6 to activate them.</p><p>With respect to the inability of Gla-less Gas6 to activate Axl, we have also added a new set of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to the revised paper. We believe that these new experiments extend the findings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in a very powerful way. We injected (intravenously) either full-length or Gla-less recombinant mouse Gas6 into <italic>Gas6-/-</italic> mice, and then monitored the co-localization of the injected proteins with red pulp macrophages in the spleen 30 minutes after injection. (These macrophages are Axl-expressing.) We found that IV-injected full-length and Gla-less Gas6 bound equally well to these cells.</p><p>However, when we examined Axl activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) in these same macrophages, we found that the full-length ligand induced strong activation, while the Gla-less Gas6 produced no Axl activation at all – equivalent to an injection of saline. We assume that the PtdSer required for Axl activation by full-length injected Gas6 comes from the blood, which is full of PtdSer-displaying microparticles (derived from platelets, erythrocytes, leukocytes, and endothelial cells). These dramatic new results are presented in the Results section of the revised paper.</p><p><italic>5) Was cell surface expression of ECDTIgITKA confirmed</italic>, <italic>to exclude the trivial possibility that it is not accessible to hPros1 in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5D</italic></xref><italic>?</italic></p><p>Yes – surface expression was confirmed. We have added a figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to document this.</p><p>Reviewer 3 major comments:</p><p><italic>[…] This reviewer sees two major concerns regarding experimental design used in this study:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors used human protein S in studies investigating the mechanisms of signaling in murine TAM receptors (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5 fig6"><italic>Figures 2C F, 5D, and 6B</italic></xref><italic>). Because the activity and specificity of protein S and Gas6 could be species-specific (ref. Hafizi and Darlback, FEBS J., 2006), it is not clear whether all the data acquired with human protein S are applicable to the signaling mechanisms of murine protein S. In addition, preparation of human protein S differed from that of murine protein S and Gas6; human protein S was purified from human serum, and both murine and human protein S were generated as His-tag-conjugated recombinant proteins. Therefore, comparison of human protein S and murine Gas6 abilities to induce signaling can be influenced by many factors, including purification methods, presence of tag sequence, and efficiency and types of post-translational modifications</italic>.</p><p><italic>Because the data that compare signaling activity and specificity of murine protein S and Gas6 are very important to properly interpret the mouse in vivo data, most of the in vitro experiments investigating signaling mechanisms of protein S should be performed using murine protein S</italic>.</p><p>As indicated above (please see our response to Reviewer 2, point 3), we have now included additional data with recombinant mouse Protein S in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its supplement (five new panels in all). It is also important to emphasize that the genetic studies we present in the retina (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), together with those we have previously published in Burstyn-Cohen et al., <italic>Neuron</italic> 76: 1123-32 (2012), unambiguously demonstrate that mouse Protein S functions as a ligand for mouse Mer.</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim that PtdSer exposed on a small fraction of cultured cells binds to the Gla domain of protein S and Gas6, and this binding is necessary for optimal signaling via TAM receptors. To clearly show that PtdSer exposed on minor cell populations plays a critical role in Gas6/protein S signaling, it will be necessary to demonstrate that induction of PtdSer exposure and elimination of exposed PtdSer on cells affect the magnitude of signaling by protein S/Gas6</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above, we have addressed this point in multiple ways. We show that a Gas6 variant that lacks its Gla domain and cannot bind PtdSer binds to Axl with wild-type affinity but is incapable of activating the receptor either in vitro or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3, 4</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We have shown that the inclusion of PtdSer-containing membranes, from either apoptotic cells or enveloped viruses, shifts the ligand dose-response activation profiles for both Axl and Mer to lower ligand concentrations (Bhattacharyya et al. <italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic> 14: 136-47 (2013); Zagórska et al., <italic>Nature Immunology</italic>, in press (October 2014), discussed in the Results section). We show that blocking PtdSer with annexin V inhibits Tyro3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and that depletion of calcium ions that are required for PtdSer-Gla domain interaction inhibits Axl activation but not binding by full-length Gas6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref>). The phagocytosis of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells in the testis and of outer segment membranes by RPE cells in the retina – the two systems we analyze genetically in our paper – have both been previously shown to be entirely dependent on the exposure of PtdSer, and in the case of the retina this exposure cycles during the day and is light-induced (Ruggiero et al., <italic>PNAS</italic> 109: 8145-8 (2012)). This is now discussed in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
