Installing and running eLife Bot
======

# Deploying to AWS.

Currently eLife bot is deployed manually using a snapshot of an Ec2 instance. 


# Project dependencies

System dependencies can be installed with `apt-get` using:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev lzma-dev
    
These are necessary for compiling `lxml`.

There is also a dependency on ImageMagic (With TIFF support). On a mac this can be installed with:

    $ brew install libtiff
    $ brew reinstall imagemagick â€“with-libtiff

Python dependencies should be installed with `pip` using:
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

And for the library `elementtree` which is not part of Pypi

    $ pip install elementtree --allow-external elementtree --allow-unverified elementtree

# Configure

Resave settings-example.py as settings.py, and enter your aws credentials.

Alternatively, place your AWS credentials in a file named .boto, or alternate method as specified at [Boto Config][botoc]

    [Credentials]
    aws_access_key_id = <your access key>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your secret key>

# Local development with Vagrant

Vagrant is used to configure a local virtual machine with standard attributes for development. See the
[elife-template-env][tmpl-env] repository for how to configure Vagrant.

[tmpl-env]: https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-template-env

1. Start a local virtual machine with Vagrant, as specified in [elife-template-env][tmpl-env]. Depending on the recipes run, it may pull code automatically from the "elife-bot" and "elife-api-prototype" repositories. If the repositories were not pulled automatically:

    git clone git://github.com/elifesciences/elife-api-prototype.git
    
    git clone git://github.com/elifesciences/elife-bot.git

2. To run tests, you must ensure the settings.py files exist and/or include the AWS credentials. At a minimum:

    cd elife-api-prototype
    
    cp settings-example.py settings.py
    
    cd elife-bot
    
    cp settings-example.py settings.py
    
    Edit the settings.py file to include your AWS credentials
    
3. Run tests:

    cd elife-bot/tests
    
    lettuce
